# Cybersecurity Process Audit GRC Sample Project

## Review Objective
This project simulates a limited-scope cybersecurity process audit for a fictional technology-driven organization. The objective is to provide risk-based assurance over whether selected cybersecurity processes are appropriately designed, consistently executed, and sufficiently evidenced to reduce cybersecurity risk across core IT and digital operations.

---

## Scope of Audit

### In-scope cybersecurity processes
- User and Access Management
- Vulnerability and Patch Management
- Incident Handling and Response

### Assessment focus
- Control Design Effectiveness
- Control Operating Effectiveness

### Environments considered
- Core IT environment
- Cloud services environment
- Business-critical application environment

### Method note
This is an evidence-led portfolio audit for a fictional organization and intentionally does not include fabricated operational metrics (for example, sample sizes, counts, or percentages). Where evidence is not available, this is explicitly stated to reflect real-world audit constraints.

## What I Did
- Defined the audit objective, scope boundaries, and audit methodology aligned to a structured cybersecurity assurance lifecycle.
- Identified in-scope assets and mapped cybersecurity process coverage across IT and digital operations.
- Identified cybersecurity risks and prioritized them using a likelihood × impact risk assessment model.
- Assessed key controls for both design effectiveness and operating effectiveness.
- Documented the basis for operating effectiveness conclusions using available evidence.
- Performed evidence-based audit testing without assuming direct access to production systems.
- Consolidated audit observations into clear findings using criteria, condition, cause, impact, and recommendation logic.
- Conducted root cause analysis to identify systemic issues driving control weaknesses.
- Developed a corrective action plan with defined ownership, priorities, dependencies, and closure validation approach.
- Produced a management-ready cybersecurity process audit report with a formal audit opinion and residual risk outlook.

## Key Outcomes
- Delivered an overall assurance conclusion of **Partially Effective (Medium Assurance)** for the audited cybersecurity processes.
- Identified high-priority risks related to:
  - Patch verification and rework-to-closure gaps
  - Missing periodic access reviews
  - Incomplete cloud administrative logging
  - Lack of post-incident review and corrective action tracking
- Translated technical control gaps into clear, management-relevant risk statements.
- Defined pragmatic corrective actions designed to improve governance, evidence retention, and sustained operating effectiveness.

## Professional Note
This repository is a portfolio sample created for demonstration purposes using a fictional organization scenario. No real organization data is included. The audit is evidence-led and avoids fabricated operational metrics; conclusions are based solely on the completeness and quality of available artefacts, consistent with professional cybersecurity audit practices.
