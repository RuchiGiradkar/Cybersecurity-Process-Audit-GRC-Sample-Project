# Cybersecurity Process Audit GRC Sample Project

## Review Objective
This project simulates a limited-scope cybersecurity process audit for a fictional technology-driven organization. The objective is to provide risk-based assurance over whether selected cybersecurity processes are appropriately designed, consistently executed, and sufficiently evidenced to reduce cybersecurity risk across core IT and digital operations. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Scope of Audit
**In-scope cybersecurity processes**
- User and Access Management
- Vulnerability and Patch Management
- Incident Handling and Response :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**Assessment focus**
- Control Design Effectiveness
- Control Operating Effectiveness :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

**Environments considered**
- Core IT environment
- Cloud services environment
- Business-critical application environment :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

**Method note**
This is an evidence-led portfolio audit for a fictional organization and intentionally does not include fabricated operational metrics (for example, sample sizes, counts, or percentages). Where evidence is not available, it is explicitly stated as such. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## What I Did
- Defined the audit objective, scope boundaries, and audit methodology aligned to a structured assurance lifecycle. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- Identified in-scope assets and mapped process coverage across IT and digital operations. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- Developed a risk register using a likelihood × impact model and prioritized risks for assurance focus. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
- Assessed key controls for design effectiveness and operating effectiveness, including documenting the basis for operating effectiveness conclusions. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- Performed evidence-based audit testing using defined procedures and expected evidence types, without assuming production system access. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- Consolidated audit observations into findings using criteria, condition, cause, impact, and recommendation logic, and identified root-cause themes. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
- Developed a corrective action plan with ownership roles, priorities, dependencies, and closure validation approach. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
- Produced a management-ready audit report with an overall assurance rating, executive risk snapshot, and residual risk outlook. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

## Key Outcomes
- Delivered an overall assurance rating of **Partially Effective (Medium Assurance)** for the audited processes based on available evidence. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
- Identified and prioritized key risks, including patch verification and rework-to-closure gaps, missing periodic access reviews, incomplete cloud administrative logging, and lack of post-incident review tracking to closure. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
- Produced a practical corrective action plan with defined closure evidence expectations to support demonstrable operating effectiveness. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

## Deliverables
- **Problem Statement:** [Problem_Statement.pdf](./Problem_Statement.pdf) :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}
- **Final Audit Report:** [Final_Audit_Report.pdf](./Final_Audit_Report.pdf) :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cybersecurity Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
- Cybersecurity process auditing and risk-based assurance
- Control design vs. operating effectiveness assessment
- Evidence-based audit testing and documentation
- Risk identification, scoring, and prioritization
- Root cause analysis and corrective action planning
- Executive-ready audit reporting :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}

## Professional Note
This repository is a **portfolio sample** created for demonstration purposes using a **fictional organization scenario**. It does not include real company data. The audit is evidence-led and avoids fabricated operational metrics; conclusions are based on the completeness and quality of available artefacts in the portfolio project pack. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}
